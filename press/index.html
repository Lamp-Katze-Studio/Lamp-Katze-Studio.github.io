                        <h2>Press Release</h2>
                        <h4>SLEEP HERD Announced, Pikmin-like Multiplayer Game by YouTuber Junferno</h4>
                        <span class="hook">Light Your Way through the dark wonderland of SLEEP HERD in this frenzied multiplayer creature collectathon.</span>

                        <p><b>June 25, 2024 - Montreal, Canada</b> - Developer and Programming YouTuber Junferno announces development of new game: SLEEP HERD, with indie team Lamp Katze Studio, coming soon Q4 2024 on Steam.
                        </p>
                        <p>SLEEP HERD is a multiplayer game that draws its inspiration from Pikmin’s creature collection  and time management mechanics, and combines it with the hectic pace of party games such as Overcooked. It's a cute and quaint twist to the fantasies about dreams and romances you'd find in ballets and bedtime stories. Each level, players must find and lead sheep spirits scattered across the map to the hearth. Spirits are attracted to fire, so the players must hold on to a source of light.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Features</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Online multiplayer</li>
                            <li>Story mode: follow the tale in a campaign of 2-4 players</li>
                            <li>Steam Achievements</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>“Making YouTube videos, I always want to tell a story. I think as a programmer, telling a story via the medium of video games is incredibly compelling. I find the most fascinating stories can merge modern machinery with fantasy -- sort of like Paprika or Serial Experiments Lain; and in a way, video games are inherently that.'' says Junferno, who is leading the programming and writing of the game.</p>
                        <p>SLEEP HERD is open for wishlist now on Steam: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3045180/SLEEP_HERD/">bit.ly/sh_steam</a></p>
